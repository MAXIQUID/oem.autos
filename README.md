# OEM.autos  
## The Factory Original Equipment Identity Layer  
### Built by **TwentyThirty™**

OEM.autos is the digital infrastructure for transforming vehicles into structured, VIN-native inventory.

We are building the **Factory Original Equipment (FOE)** ecosystem — a new standard for dismantling, cataloging, and listing OEM parts instantly, directly from the vehicle source.

Unlike traditional scrapyard systems, OEM.autos treats every vehicle as a structured dataset:

> VIN → Digital BOM → SKU Graph → Live Parts Inventory

## 🚘 What OEM.autos Enables

OEM.autos powers a new dismantling paradigm:

- Vehicles become inventory the moment they arrive  
- Parts receive identity before removal  
- Listings are generated instantly  
- Provenance is preserved permanently  
- Dismantling becomes demand-driven and Just-in-Time  

This is the operating system for the post-scrapyard economy.

## 🔑 Core Concept: VIN-Native Inventory

Every vehicle is anchored by its VIN.

From that VIN, OEM.autos generates:

- OEM build configuration  
- Factory Bill of Materials (BOM)  
- Part identity graph  
- Pre-assigned SKU space (up to 999 parts per vehicle)  
- Marketplace-ready dismantle listings  

This enables dismantlers to list parts *as they are removed*, not weeks later.

## ⚙️ TwentyThirty Workflow (Reverse-Dismantling)

Traditional dismantling:

1. Remove parts  
2. Store parts  
3. Identify parts later  
4. List manually  

TwentyThirty dismantling:

1. VIN intake + imaging  
2. OEM BOM expansion  
3. Pre-label high-value parts  
4. Activate SKUs as removed  
5. Listings go live instantly  
6. Provenance remains attached forever  

This is **Just-in-Time dismantling**.

## 📦 The Factory Original Equipment (FOE) Standard

OEM.autos introduces FOE — a modular identity schema for OEM parts.

Each part record may include:

- VIN origin  
- OEM part number  
- Category + subsystem  
- Condition + imaging  
- Removal timestamp  
- Technician chain-of-custody  
- Marketplace export readiness  

FOE turns dismantling into structured manufacturing in reverse.

## 🧱 Repository Ecosystem

OEM.autos is not a monolith.

It is a decentralized platform composed of:

- Brand catalogs  
- Auction ingestion feeds (Copart, IAA)  
- Marketplace category maps (eBay Motors)  
- OEM part-type ontologies (RevolutionParts)  
- VIN-based dismantling graphs  

Example modules:

- `catalogs/` — OEM parts + BOM structures  
- `vehicles/` — VIN-based intake records  
- `part-types/` — Universal dismantle taxonomies  
- `marketplace/` — eBay + distributor export layers  
- `foe-schema/` — Factory Original Equipment identity spec  

---

## 🌍 Public + Private Platform Split

OEM.autos supports a dual ecosystem:

### **OpenROE** (Public Layer)
- Auction listings  
- Public marketplace intelligence  
- Open dismantling taxonomies  

### **MaxiROE** (Commercial Layer)
- Private dismantler inventory  
- Technician workflow + privileges  
- Real-time SKU activation  
- Monetized sale events + exports

## 🔧 Primary Use Cases

OEM.autos enables:

- Instant multi-channel parts listing  
- VIN-native dismantler inventory systems  
- Circular economy and ELV intelligence  
- OEM-grade provenance and part passports  
- Reverse manufacturing BOM automation  
- High-scale warehousing of vehicle intelligence  

---

## 🏁 Vision

By 2030, dismantling will be VIN-native.

Every OEM part will have:

- identity  
- provenance  
- market availability  
- structured reuse pathways  

OEM.autos is the foundation.
