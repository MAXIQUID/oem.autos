# OEM.autos

OEM.autos is a modular and extensible ecosystem for collecting, structuring, and leveraging original equipment manufacturer (OEM) automotive data.  

Unlike monolithic databases, OEM.autos is designed as a **decentralized collection of brand-specific repositories**, each uniquely tailored to the data nuances, attributes, and characteristics of that brand and its models.

---

## 🎯 Core Philosophy

- **Brand-centric modularity:** Each OEM repository independently collects and organizes data unique to its brand, allowing flexibility in data structure and scope.  
- **Surrogate digital twins:** Many repos leverage FiveM vehicle packs as starting points, using them as surrogate digital twins for real-world vehicles.  
- **Evolving schema:** Rather than enforcing rigid schemas, OEM.autos encourages organic growth and adaptation based on available data and brand needs.  
- **Interoperability:** Shared vocabularies and metadata standards are evolving to enable integration across repos without sacrificing individual flexibility.  
- **Comprehensive data scope:** Parts, trims, fitments, images, repair info, lifecycle data, and more — collected as available per brand.

## 📁 Repository Organization

Each brand repository (e.g., `BMW.OEM.autos`, `Toyota.OEM.autos`) generally contains:

- `vehicles/` — Vehicle model data and digital twin configurations  
- `parts/` — Detailed OEM parts catalog and references  
- `fitment/` — Compatibility and vehicle configuration data  
- `resources/` — Images, diagrams, logos, and related assets  
- `meta/` — Metadata, versioning, and mapping information  

Structure and contents vary based on brand-specific data needs.
